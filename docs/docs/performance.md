While performance is already at the heart of Gatsby, it's important to ensure you are doing all you can to make your content available to your users as fast as possible. When the next billion users coming onto the internet aren't coming from high speed data connections or from desktop computers, it's important to provide the smallest and fastest website you can. Since Gatsby is already doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you there isn't a lot required to make a your site blazing fast, but by following these guides you can ensure the best possible performance and delivery of your content to your users.

In this section we'll cover some ways you can optimize caching, set up `https` on `localhost` for easier testing of performance features, as well as how to measure the performance of your websites, giving you all the tools you need to max out your websites performance.

May your Lighthouse scores all be in the green. ðŸ˜€
